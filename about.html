## About

Hi I am Jay Batra. I am an MCA student at Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak. I am a budding data scientist. My interests mostly revolve around the same. I am also a GSOC aspirant and currently contributing to <a href="https://github.com/go-hep/hep">Go-HEP</a>. Now that you are here, you might also like to explore other links. Feel free to <a href="jaybatra73@gmail.com">mail</a> me if you have any feedback. If you have a really awesome project that you think would be a perfect fit as per my interests, here's my <a href="/assets/docs/JayBatraCV.pdf">CV</a>.
